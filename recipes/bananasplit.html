        <h2>Description</h2>
        A classic ice cream dessert that is extra popular during the summer months. Banana splits get their name because 
        the a whole banana is split or cut down the middle and that is the first layer of this dessert.
        Banana splits are typically made with three flavors of ice cream: vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate. 
        They are then topped with hot fudge or chocolate sauce, whipped cream, maraschino cherries and crushed nuts.

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 banana </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup vanilla ice cream </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup strawberry ice cream </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup chocolate ice cream </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons hot fudge sauce </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons strawberry sauce </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup whipped cream </li>
        <li> 3 maraschino cherries </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Peel the banana and slice in half lengthwise. Place a slice of banana on either side 
            of a medium sized shallow bowl. </li>
        <li> Place one scoop each of vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate ice cream, in a row down 
            the center of the bowl. They should be placed in between the banana slices. </li>
        <li> Drizzle the hot fudge, caramel sauce, and strawberry over the entire dish. I recommend
             going side to side from one end of the bananas to the other to get your traditional
              banana split appearance. </li>
        <li> Top each scoop of ice cream with a large dollop of whipped cream or you can pipe it on if you prefer. </li>
        <li> Place a maraschino cherry on top of each scoop of whipped cream and sprinkle crushed nuts over the top of the banana split. </li>
        <li> Serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
