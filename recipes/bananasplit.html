        A classic ice cream dessert that is extra popular during the summer months. Banana splits get their name because 
        the a whole banana is split or cut down the middle and that is the first layer of this dessert.
        Banana splits are typically made with three flavors of ice cream: vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate. They are then topped with hot fudge or chocolate sauce, whipped cream, maraschino cherries and crushed nuts.
