        <h2>Description</h2>
        One of my first experiences with New York Style Pizza was stepping off the train into Penn Station and smelling the air filled with pizza aroma. 
        A few steps away and you have a pizza display case ready for your choosing. If you want that NYC style pizza pie at home, try this recipe.

    <h3> Dough Making </h3>

        <li> Add corn meal, olive oil and yeast, and continue mixing it for one minute. Let it rest for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the remaining flour and mix it with your hands.</li>
        <li> Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead the dough about 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
        <li> Form the dough into a ball and place it in a covered bowl at an ambient 
            temperature of 70째F-85째F. Let it rest about 45 minutes to 1 hour. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Making the Pie Crust </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Push down the dough and make a 12" to 14" circle with your hands or a rolling pin, if you prefer.
             See more specific instructions for Panning the Pizza Dough in our "How To Make Pizza" section. </li>
        <li> Rub the olive oil on the baking sheet and place the pizza dough on it, let it rest for another 45 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Sauce Making </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Combine all of the sauce ingredients in a sauce pan and cook into a smooth sauce, on medium heat, stirring regularly. </li>
        <li> Refrigerate or cool to room temperature before applying to the pizza. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Assembly and Baking </h3>
    <ol> 
        <li> Preheat your oven to 400째F. </li>
        <li> Brush the olive oil in the area of the pizza dough on the center, but not brush on the outer ring of the dough. </li>
        <li> Spread the pizza sauce, mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings on the dough. </li>
        <li> Place the pizza into the oven on the lowest rack, reduce your oven temperature to 375째F, and bake about 8 to 10 minutes, or, until the crust has browned and the toppings are bubbly. </li>
    </ol>
