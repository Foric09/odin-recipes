    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 350° F. Spray 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside. </li>
        <li> Cook beef with taco seasoning mix, according to seasoning package instructions. </li>
        <li> To prepare 1 burrito: spread ¼ cup beans down center of tortillas; top with ½ cup rice, beef, 2 tablespoons corn, and ¼ cup cheese. </li>
        <li> Fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, then roll up, burrito style. Place, seam-sides down,
